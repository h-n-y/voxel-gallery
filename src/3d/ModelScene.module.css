   * Why absolute positioning?
   *
   * On the window "resize" event, the canvas is resized to fit
   * its container. If the canvas position is static, then its
   * parent height won't shrink as the viewport shrinks because
   * the canvas height prevents it from doing so.
   *
   * Positioning the canvas absolutely removes the canvas from
   * the normal layout and allows its parent to resize "naturally"
   * to the shrinking viewport height, which is what we want here.
